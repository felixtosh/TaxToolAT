/**
 * How a § 11 classification reads on screen (#205).
 *
 * The verdict, the basis behind it and the missing elements are decided by
 * `functions/src/documents/classifyDocumentType.ts` and stored on the file.
 * Nothing here re-derives any of that — this module only turns the stored
 * enums into words, and it is the single place those words live so the file
 * surfaces and the transaction surfaces cannot describe the same document
 * differently.
 *
 * Two rules shape the wording:
 *
 *   `unknown` is not an error and not an empty field. It is the common case
 *   until the backfill and the re-extraction sweep run, and it has to read as
 *   "not established" — a state the record is honestly in, not a failure.
 *
 *   A missing element is only a defect when the document is a receipt. A
 *   reverse-charge invoice lawfully prints no Austrian rate and often no
 *   sequential number; it is an invoice, and its unprinted elements are
 *   reported, never held against it.
 *
 * Plain data in, plain data out — no React, no Firestore, no formatting of a
 * component's choosing — so the whole vocabulary is testable with node --test.

/**
 * The four document types.
 *
 * ## Three kinds of German live in this file, and only one of them translates
 *
 * The product UI is English. These labels used to be German anyway, which is
 * where the Denglish came from: an English screen with `Nicht bestimmt` and
 * `Nur Zahlungsbeleg` on it. But not every German string here is the same kind
 * of string, and flattening them all to English would be just as wrong:
 *
 *   1. **UI chrome** — these labels, and the direction labels below. They name
 *      a state to the person reading the screen, so they follow the interface
 *      locale. `label` is the English default that non-React callers (the agent
 *      tools, the exports, the node tests) get; `labelKey` resolves through
 *      messages/{en,de}.json for anything rendering to a person.
 *   2. **Statutory terms** — `SECTION_11_ELEMENTS` below, and the words
 *      Vorsteuer, UID and § 11 inside the summaries. These are citations. An
 *      English UI still says Vorsteuer, because that is the name of the thing
 *      in the law the user is subject to, and because the operator quotes them
 *      verbatim to a supplier. They never translate.
 *   3. **Outgoing correspondence** — `buildSupplierRequestText`. German because
 *      the RECIPIENT is an Austrian supplier, which has nothing to do with what
 *      language the user reads the app in. It stays German even for an English
 *      interface.
 *
 * `tone` is a presentation-neutral name a component maps to its own badge
 * variant: `unset` is deliberately its own tone rather than a shade of
 * `warning`, because "we have not established this" must not look like a
 * finding against the document.
 *
 * `tone` is a presentation-neutral name a component maps to its own badge

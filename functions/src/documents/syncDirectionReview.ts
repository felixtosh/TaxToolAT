/**
 * Keeping the direction-review flags in step with the links (#233).
 *
 * The rule itself is pure and lives in `directionReview.ts`. This module owns
 * only the reads and the write-if-changed, the same split as
 * `syncDocumentationState.ts`.
 *
 * Three callers, because three different things can move the answer:
 *  - `onTransactionUpdate`, when a transaction gains or loses files, or when
 *    its amount changes;
 *  - the extraction path, when a file's direction is (re)decided;
 *  - `update_file_extraction`, when a person sets the direction by hand.

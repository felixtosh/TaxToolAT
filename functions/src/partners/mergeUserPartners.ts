/**
 * Fold one or more Partners into another because they are the same business
 * (#262, semantics in [ADR-0005](docs/adr/0005-partner-merge-is-one-way.md)).
 *
 * The caller names the survivor and the losers. Nothing here infers which
 * record should live: a Merge cannot be undone, so no heuristic gets to make
 * that call. Several losers go in at once because duplicates arrive in clusters
 * rather than pairs.
 *
 * What the survivor gains: every single value it was missing, filled from the
 * losers in the order given, and a union of every multi-valued identifying
 * collection — aliases, IBANs, email domains, and the learned patterns
 * including the negative signals that record which Transactions and Files the
 * user pulled off a Partner. Each loser's name joins the survivor's aliases:
 * that is the knowledge the duplicate proved, and dropping it would make
 * merging a duplicate destroy the reason it existed. Where the survivor already
 * holds a different value it keeps its own and the loser's is recorded on the
 * Merged Partner rather than dropped.
 *
 * What each loser becomes: a **Merged Partner** — inactive, carrying
 * `mergedInto`, therefore out of the Partner list and out of the match
 * candidate set (both are `isActive == true` queries). It is still read back as
 * itself. A caller holding a stale id has to be told once so it can update; a
 * silent redirect to the survivor teaches it that the stale id is fine forever.
 * Tombstones never chain: merging a survivor onward rewrites every Merged
 * Partner that pointed at it, so a pointer is always one hop from a live
 * Partner and no consumer needs loop detection.
 *
 * What a Merge does NOT do:
 * - It does not re-run the Match. It reports how many unmatched Transactions
 *   the survivor's new identifying data would now hit and leaves the existing
 *   reviewed rematch path (`partner_rematch_report`) to act on that. Silent
 *   re-attribution of bookings is what makes people stop trusting the
 *   operation.
 * - It does not touch what an issued Invoice froze at issue time. Only the
 *   pointer beside the frozen recipient block moves, for every Invoice status,
 *   because the snapshot is the document of record either way.
 * - It does not touch Notifications. They record events that already happened,
 *   and rewriting them would rewrite history.
 * - It does not rewrite `partnerSuggestions` on Transactions or Files, or the
 *   `searchSuggestions.partnerId` cache key. Firestore cannot query an array of
 *   objects by member field, so repointing suggestions means a full scan of
 *   both collections inside a mutation; a suggestion naming a Merged Partner
 *   resolves against the Partner list, which no longer contains it, and the
 *   matcher overwrites it on its next pass. The cache key is deliberately left
 *   stale so the cache invalidates instead of silently surviving the merge.

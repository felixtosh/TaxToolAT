/**
 * updateFile writes metadata, and only metadata.
 *
 * It used to accept the extracted figures too, on a path that consolidated
 * the line items into the total — a derivation written as if a person had
 * ruled on it, with no provenance stamp a re-extraction would respect, and
 * none of the reconciliation re-derivation #203 introduced. Its copy loop
 * also forwarded EVERY key of the payload into the Firestore update, so a
 * caller could write any field on their own file record — a provenance
 * stamp, a derived classification, a review flag. Both doors are closed:
 * figure fields are refused towards updateFileExtractedFields, and unknown
 * keys are refused outright.

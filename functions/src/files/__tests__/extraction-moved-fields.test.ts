/**
 * #149: which fields a *form* save actually moved.
 *
 * The MCP tool sends the fields a caller deliberately named, so "present"
 * means "corrected" there. The file detail panel sends the whole extracted
 * record on every save, so "present" means nothing at all — stamping it would
 * mark a file hand-corrected on all five fields the first time someone opens
 * the panel and clicks save without typing.
 *
 * The comparison therefore lives on the server, next to the builder that
 * stamps, and this is its test: what is proposed is compared against what is
 * stored, and only the difference is treated as a correction.

/**
 * #310: the bound on a hand-set Trinkgeld, through both correction doors.
 *
 * #217 gave `extractedTipAmount` a writer and left it unbounded. The damage a
 * wrong figure does there is not VAT — a tip is outside the scope of it, and
 * nothing subtracts it from `extractedAmount` — it is matching: 600,00 typed
 * into the tip box of a 40,00 Beleg moves the reconciled total off every bank
 * line there is, and the file becomes unmatchable with nothing on the record
 * saying why.
 *
 * The bound is not one number, which is the whole reason this ticket exists.
 * A tip the document PRINTS is inside the document total; a tip it never
 * printed sits on top of it and only the bank line knows how large it can be.
 * So the default is the document total, and a correction can declare itself
 * the second shape — which MOVES the bound to the transaction total rather
 * than removing it.

/**
 * #217: the Trinkgeld the document never printed, end to end.
 *
 * The printed case was settled by #172 — Summe, Trinkgeld, Gesamt, three
 * numbers on the Beleg and three fields on the record. This is the shape that
 * left no way out: the terminal took a tip, the receipt says nothing about it,
 * so the bank line is larger than a § 11-complete invoice and every consumer
 * reads that gap as an unexplained overpay. `extractedTipAmount` had a reader
 * everywhere and a writer only in the extractor, which can transcribe a tip
 * and cannot invent one.
 *
 * The walk below is the acceptance criterion: the same restaurant invoice
 * before and after a person types the tip, through the scorer that puts it on
 * its bank line and the derivation that claims its Vorsteuer.
 *
 * The trap it guards is the quiet one. A tip on a document whose total never
 * included it must NOT come out of `extractedAmount`: that total already is
 * the VAT-bearing figure, and shrinking it by the tip under-claims the return
 * without anything failing.

/**
 * The file detail panel's save, as a callable (#149).
 *
 * The panel used to write the extracted record straight to Firestore from the
 * browser. That is a direct client write of a business decision — the thing the
 * Cloud Functions pattern in CLAUDE.md exists to prevent — and it had a
 * concrete cost: the provenance stamp #147 introduced is written inside
 * `buildExtractionCorrection`, which only the MCP tool went through, so a
 * correction typed by a person was re-rolled by the next
 * `retry_file_extraction` while the same correction made by an agent was
 * protected. The UI is the common case, so the guard covered the rarer half.
 *
 * Two things stay on the server because they are the same decision twice:
 *
 *   - *what a correction does* — `buildCorrectedFileUpdate`, shared with the
 *     MCP tool, including the derived § 11 classification and rate-review flag.
 *   - *what actually moved* — `selectMovedCorrections`. The panel posts the
 *     whole record on every save, so without that comparison the first save of
 *     an untouched file would mark all five fields hand-corrected and freeze it
 *     against re-extraction for good.
 *
 * The panel keeps its string parsing (a currency field is a UI concern) and
 * sends typed values: cents, an ISO date, normalised line items.

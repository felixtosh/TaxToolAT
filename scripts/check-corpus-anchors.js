/**
 * Refuse anchors that point at one operator's private documents.
 *
 * Both repositories are public. Test fixtures were written against a real
 * bookkeeping corpus, and the fastest way to write one is to name the document
 * it came from: `paperless-ap-1004`, `IV-26-1170`, `FIBU_20260109-8624`. Those
 * identifiers resolve to nothing for a reader — they are only meaningful
 * inside the self-hosted instance they were copied from, which is exactly what
 * makes them a leak rather than documentation.
 *
 * The fix is never to delete the case. A test that encodes a real defect is
 * the most valuable kind there is. It is to describe the document instead of
 * naming it: `f-insurance-11pct` says what the fixture IS, and survives the
 * corpus it came from.
 *
 * Runs before `npm ci` in CI, like `check-web-build-args.js`, so it fails in
 * seconds and needs no dependencies.
